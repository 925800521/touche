## Effortlessly re-map click events to touch events on touchscreen UIs

[Full docs](http://benhowdle.im/touche)

<ul>
		<li>Takes your click events applied with JavaScript or jQuery and silently re-maps them to the "touchend" event for devices that support touch.</li>
		<li>Removes the 300ms delay (after the user lifts their finger), applied by all touchscreens devices and immediately invokes your click handlers.</li>
		<li>Works interchangeably with JavaScript click events or jQuery applied click events (through jQuery's .on() method).</li>
</ul>
